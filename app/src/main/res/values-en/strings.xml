    <string name="title1">Why do people with disabilities need help?</string>
    <string name="text1">People with disabilities are marginalized. About 5.5 million people with disabilities live in Poland. We tend to translate the physical characteristics of people into their personality traits, this is the so-called "halo effect," such people are treated not mediocre but extremely (idealized or incomprehensible image of a human being). The mental and physical comfort of people with disabilities is reduced compared to the average person, so it is worth helping them. These people feel lonely more often:</string>

    <string name="title2">What is the life of a person with a disability?</string>
    <string name="text2">Treating a person with a disability as a picture of the disorder is harmful and harmful, and that person is also a human being. These people experience many problems and challenges in their lives that can lead to thoughts of suicide or even depression. According to the studies conducted in 2009â€“2015, symptoms of depression were noticed in as many as 65% of chronically ill people, but mainly people with acquired disabilities suffer.</string>
